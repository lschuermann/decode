            The number of chunks in an object can be calculated as
                chunk_count = ceil(object_size / chunk_size)
            . Chunks are evenly distributed over the entire object, and the
            start address of a chunk `i` can be calculated as
                chunk_start = i * chunk_size
            . In case `object_size` is not evenly divisible by `chunk_size`,
            the last chunk may be smaller than `chunk_size`, its size can
            be calculated as `object_size mod chunk_size`.

            The number of shards in a chunk can be calculated as
                shard_count = ceil(chunk_size / shard_size)
            . Shards are evenly distributed over a chunk, and the

            the last shard may be smaller than `shard_size`, its size can
            be calculated as `chunk_size mod shard_size`. For purposes of
            parity shard calculation and reconstruction, the last chunk is to
            be padded to the full `shard_size` with null-bytes.
